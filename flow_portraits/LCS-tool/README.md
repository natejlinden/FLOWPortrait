LCS Tool
========

LCS Tool performs computations for the analysis of Lagrangian coherent structures. It is developed by the Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Group at [ETH Zurich](http://ETHZ.CH), led by [Prof. George Haller](http://GeorgeHaller.COM).

Demo scripts
------------

MATLAB scripts demonstrating the use of LCS Tool are in the folder named demo. To run these scripts, start MATLAB in the LCS Tool folder, then at the MATLAB prompt type, for example:

	cd(fullfile('demo','double_gyre'))
	addpath(fullfile('..','..'))
	elliptic_hyperbolic_lcs
